   "About": "As for more relaxed things to do in Ann Arbor for couples, nothing can beat Nichols Arboretum. These grounds are very secluded and quiet â€“ just the thing for couples that want to enjoy each other and not the crowds of strangers. The scenery changes all the time: new plans, new flowers and trees. You will love this setting and maybe it will become your usual place.",
